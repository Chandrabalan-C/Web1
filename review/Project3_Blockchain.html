            Blockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that
            allows transparent information sharing within a business network.
            A blockchain database stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain.
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            The purpose of the blockchain is to share information amongst all parties
            that access it via an application. Access to this ledger in terms of reading 
            and writing may be unrestricted ('permissionless'), or restricted ('permissioned').
        </p>

        <p id="p3">
            Blockchain is gaining a lot of popularity, it's also beginning to challenge practices 
            in business sectors, too. In fact, many industries are finding blockchain technology 
            to be an innovation that is revolutionizing the way they work and service clients.
